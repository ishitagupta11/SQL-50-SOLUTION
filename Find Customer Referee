# Write your MySQL query statement below
select name
from customer
where referee_id!=2  or referee_id is null;

#Explanation
We use not equal to 2 as the question has asked us the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2
We used null because we want the names that have referee_id as null if we don't use null then we will only get the output zack (as it has referee_id not 2)

#Different Approaches
There will be slight change in where condition select and from will remain same

Approach 1 (Best Approach) - where referee_id<>2 or referee_id is null;

Approach 2 (Worst Approach)- where referee_id=1 or referee_id is null;
